I need to design initial page.
## How this page work?
- This page is initial page that user when see.
- This page using for connecting to social media such as: Facebook, Shopee, Tiktok...
- This page is using for selecting shop or group-shop before go to main layout.
- This page will show 3 parts: 1 for connecting button; 1 for list shop and group-shop that user ownership; 1 for list shop and group-shop that user work with manage role or sale staff. the box display shop will include avatar, name, id, name company
- This page have two flows:

A. User with role as staff/manager for other user who ownership company with their shop and group-shop.
When access they can view some pages (message chat, order, base setting)
B. User with role as o for other user who ownership company with their shop and group-shop
When access they can view all page (analytic, costs, revenue ...)
